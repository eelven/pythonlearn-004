You can write any code you like in the window below. There are three files loaded
and ready for you to open if you want to do file processing: "mbox-short.txt", 
"romeo.txt", and "words.txt".
fh = open("romeo.txt", "r")
count = 0
for line in fh:
    print line.strip()
    count = count + 1
print count,"Lines"
Your Output
But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
4 Lines

8.4 Open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line, split the line into a list of words using the split()
function. The program should build a list of words. For each word on each line check to see if the word is already in 
the list and if not append it to the list. When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in 
alphabetical order.
You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/romeo.txt
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()
for line in fh:
    for word in line.split():
        lst.append(word)
lst = list(set(lst))
lst.sort()
print lst
Your Output
['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already', 'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief', 'is', 'kill', 
'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft', 'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window', 'with', 'yonder']

8.5 Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line. When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the 
following line
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the 
person who sent the message). Then print out a count at the end.
Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
You can download the sample data at http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/mbox-short.txt
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
if len(fname) < 1 : fname = "mbox-short.txt"
fh = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fh:
  line.rstrip()
  if line.startswith("From "):
    print line.split()[1]
    count += 1
print "There were", count, "lines in the file with From as the first word"
